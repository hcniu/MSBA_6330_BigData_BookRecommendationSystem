### MSBA_6330_BigData_BookRecommendationSystem

Recommendation systems are used by pretty much every major company in order to enhance the quality of their services by understanding the taste of the customers. The main audience of our recommendation system is businesses that want to generate additional business / revenue by strategically recommending products to customers based on their tastes and ratings given to similar products.

To provide recommendations based on user ratings, we will use a technique called Collaborative Filtering which is based on the concept that if person A and B have given similar ratings to the same objects, then they have similar interests; therefore, there is a higher probability that person A will also like a product they haven’t considered before, but the product is rated highly by person B. Spark’s machine learning library (MLlib) has the ALS function which can be used for this. We also plan to employ Amazon SageMaker to construct the recommendation system.
 
The tutorial will walk the audience through our recommendation system of books. We’ll discuss how the recommendation system works and showcase actual recommendations delivered to users.
 
Our team will use the following websites to assist with building our recommendation system:
